    abstract = { The paper is concerned with the optimum routing of a fleet of gasoline delivery trucks between a bulk terminal and a large number of service stations supplied by the terminal. The shortest routes between any two points in the system are given and a demand for one or several products is specified for a number of stations within the distribution system. It is desired to find a way to assign stations to trucks in such a manner that station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is a minimum A procedure based on a linear programming formulation is given for obtaining a near optimal solution. The calculations may be readily performed by hand or by an automatic digital computing machine. No practical applications of the method have been made as yet. A number of trial problems have been calculated, however. }

  abstract = {Majority of the products can be assembled in several ways that means
 the same final product can be realized by different sequences of
 assembly operations. Different degree of difficulty is associated
 with each sequence of assembly operation and such difficulties are
 caused by the different mechanical constraints forced by the different
 sequences of operations. In the past, few notable attempts have been
 made to represent and enumerate the degree of difficulty associated
 with an assembly sequence (in the form of triangular fuzzy number)
 by using the concept of assembly graph. However, such representation
 schemes do not possess the capabilities to model the user's reasoning
 and preferences. In this research, an intelligent Petri net model
 that combines the abilities of modelling, planning and performance
 evaluation for assembly operation is presented. This modelling tool
 can represent the issues concerning degree of difficulty associated
 with assembly sequences. The proposed mechanism is enhanced expert
 high-level colored fuzzy Petri net (EEHLCFPN) that is a hybrid of
 knowledge-based system and colored Petri net. An example encompassing
 assembly of subassemblies is considered to efficiently delineate

  abstract = {Inspired by the vertebrate immune system, artificial immune system
 (AIS) has emerged as a new branch of computational intelligence.
 This paper explores the application of AIS in the problem of assembly
 planning and proposes a novel approach, called the immune optimization
 approach (IOA), to generate the optimal assembly plan. Based on the
 bionic principles of AIS, IOA introduces manifold immune operations
 including immune selection, clonal selection, inoculation and immune
 metabolism to derive the optimal assembly sequence. Maintenance of
 population diversity, attention to the local as well as the global
 search, and employment of heuristic knowledge to direct the search
 of optimized assembly sequences are the major concerns of IOA. The
 details of IOA are presented and the immune operations are discussed.
 Two practical products are taken as examples to illustrate the validity
 of IOA in assembly planning, and encouraging solutions in quality
 and efficiency are achieved. Comparisons with genetic algorithm demonstrate
 that IOA finds the optimal assembly solution or near-optimal ones
 more reliably and more efficiently, indicating that IOA has potential
 and advantages in dealing with assembly planning. Â© Springer-Verlag

  abstract = {Assembly sequence planning (ASP) needs to take relevant constraint
 factors such as the geometric characteristics and tool factors into
 consideration so as to work out a particular assembly sequence. At
 last, a product will come into being through the assembly of each
 part according to the assembly sequence. A problem encountered in
 ASP is that a larger number of components will cause more constraints
 to assembly a product, thus increasing the complexity of assembly
 problem. Therefore, it has been an objective for researchers to look
 for suitable methods for the solution space of feasible solutions.
 Among them, traditional genetic algorithms (GAs) belong to a random
 searching method. When the constraints are complicated in ASP, GAs
 often come out with a large number of solutions not feasible. Consequently,
 previous research results have proposed some approaches such as Guided
 genetic algorithms (Guided-GAs) or memetic algorithms (MAs) to enhance
 the structure of GAs to cope with the complexity of constraints in
 ASP problems. In this study, artificial immune systems (AIS) were
 proposed to help solve the assembly sequence problem. In AIS algorithm,
 the antibody (Ab) in the immune system is simulated to encounter
 one or more unknown antigens (Ags). Moreover, the clonal selection
 concept is employed in the immune system in which a better antibody
 will be selected in each generation of revolution and different antibodies
 will be cloned to protect the infection of the original antigen.
 With this mechanism, the shortcoming such as the traditional GAs
 to converge in local optimal solution will be overcome. Practical
 examples have demonstrated that AIS can solve the ASP problem with
 complicated constraints. Compared with guided genetic algorithms
 and memetic algorithms, AIS can generate the same or better solutions
 in terms of quality and searching time. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

 Assembly motions are parameterized such that each point in motion

 part set. For each motion we derive blocking relations that explicitly
 state which parts collide with other parts; each subassembly (rigid
 subset of parts) that does not collide with the rest of the assembly
 can easily be derived from the blocking relations. Motion space is
 partitioned into an arrangement of cells such that the blocking relations
 are fixed within each cell. We apply the approach to assembly motions
 of several useful types, including one-step translations, multistep
 translations, and infinitesimal rigid motions. Several efficiency
 improvements are described, as well as methods to include additional
 assembly constraints into the framework. The resulting algorithms
 have been implemented and tested extensively on complex assemblies.
 We conclude by describing some remaining open problems.},

 product using AND/OR graphs is presented. Such a representation forms
 the basis for efficient planning algorithms that make possible an
 increase in assembly system flexibility by allowing an intelligent
 robot to pick a course of action according to instantaneous conditions.
 The AND/OR graph is equivalent to a state transition graph but requires
 fewer nodes and simplifies the search for feasible plans. Three applications
 are discussed: the preselection of the best assembly plan, the recovery
 from execution errors, and the opportunistic scheduling of tasks.
 The same approach used to preselect the best assembly plan can be
 used to preselect the best disassembly plan. A change in the definition
 of goal nodes allows the preselection of the best disassembly plan
 that will release a given part for maintenance or repair tasks. An
 example of an assembly with four parts illustrates the use of the
 AND/OR graph representation to find the best assembly plan based
 on the weighting of operations according to complexity of manipulation
 and stability of subassemblies. In practice, a generic search algorithm,
 such as the AO*, can be used to find this plan. A hypothetical error
 situation in the assembly of the four-part assembly is discussed
 to show how a button-up search of the AND/OR graph leads to an efficient
 recovery. The scheduling efficiency using this representation is
 compared with fixed sequence and precedence graph representations

 to construct a product from its individual parts. Previous research
 has investigated assembly sequencing under the assumption that parts
 have nominal geometry. This paper considers the case where parts
 have toleranced geometry. Its main contribution is an efficient procedure
 that decides if a product admits an assembly sequence with infinite
 translations (i.e. translations that can be extended arbitrarily
 far along a fixed direction), that is feasible for all possible instances
 of the components within the specified tolerances. If the product
 admits one such sequence, the procedure can also generate it. For
 the cases where there exists no such assembly sequence, another procedure
 is proposed which generates assembly sequences that are feasible
 only for some values of the toleranced dimensions. If this procedure
 produces no such sequence, then no instance of the product is assemblable.
 These two procedures are described for 2D assemblies made of polygonial
 parts and for 3D assemblies made of polyhedral parts. So far, only
 the first has been implemented (for the planar case). This work assumes
 a simple, but non-trivial tolerance language that falls short of
 capturing all imperfections of a manufacturing process. In particular,
 it assumes that faces and edges have perfect relative orientations.
 Thus, it is only one step towards dealing with tolerances in assembly
 sequencing. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

 sequences encompassed by the assembly plan. The second criterion
 is to maximize the amount of parallelism (i.e., simultaneity) that
 is possible in the execution of the assembly tasks. While the metrics
 corresponding to the criteria used in previous work can be expressed
 as a sum of terms, each being a function of a task or a state, the
 metrics corresponding to the criteria introduced are more complex

 a heuristic search for the best assembly plan over the AND/OR graph

  abstract = {Purpose - In this paper, an assembly sequence planning system, based
 on binary vector representations, is developed. The neural network
 approach has been employed for analyzing optimum assembly sequence
 for assembly systems. Design/methodology/approach - The input to
 the assembly system is the assembly's connection graph that represents
 parts and relations between these parts. The output to the system
 is the optimum assembly sequence. In the constitution of assembly's
 connection graph, a different approach employing contact matrices
 and Boolean operators has been used. Moreover, the neural network
 approach is used in the determination of optimum assembly sequence.
 The inputs to the networks are the collection of assembly sequence
 data. This data is used to train the network using the back propagation
 (BP) algorithm. Findings - The proposed neural network model outperforms
 the available assembly sequence-planning model in predicting the
 optimum assembly sequence for mechanical parts. Due to the parallel
 structure and fast learning of neural network, this kind of algorithm
 will be utilized to model another types of assembly systems. Research
 limitations/implications - In the proposed neural approach, the back
 propagation algorithm is used. Various training algorithms can be
 employed. Practical implications - The simulation results suggest
 that the neural predictor would be used as a predictor for possible
 practical applications on modeling assembly sequence planning system.
 Originality/value - This paper discusses a new modelling scheme known
 as artificial neural networks. The neural network approach has been
 employed for analyzing feasible assembly sequences and optimum assembly
 sequence for assembly systems. Â© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

  volume = {15},
  pages = {543-559},

  abstract = {In this article, an approach is described for the development of a
 process for the determination of geometric feasibility whose binary
 vector representation corresponds to assembly states. An assembly
 consisting of four parts is considered as an example. First, contact
 matrices generate the assembly's connection graph. The developing
 connection graph was used to model the example assembly. In the assembly's
 connection graph, each node corresponds to a part in the assembly,
 and edges in the graph of connections correspond to connecting every
 pair of nodes. Moreover, in the connection graph, each connection
 corresponds to an element in the binary vector representation. In
 the development of the approach, intersection matrices are used to
 represent interference among assembling parts during the assembly
 operation. Intersection matrices are defined to along the Cartesian
 coordinate system's six main directions. The elements of intersection
 matrices are constituted to Boolean values. Each element of binary
 vector representations includes a connection between a pair of parts.
 First, ordered pairs of parts are established. Then, Cartesian products,
 which are produced from these established ordered pairs of parts,
 are applied to Boolean operators. Finally, geometric feasibility
 of these binary vector representations is determined. In this work,
 some assembly systems are sampled and examined. Among these examples,
 six assembly sequences for a four-part packing system; two assembly
 sequences for a five-part shaft bearing system; 373 assembly sequences
 for a seven-part clutch system and assembly states have been investigated.},

 stage. Under the consideration of economy, the green recycle of a

 recycling cost of the discarded product. This study attempted to
 build up a disassembly-oriented assessment method for product modular
 design in four stages. At Stage 1, the liaison intensity was used
 to quantify the connection relations among parts by their engineering
 information. At Stage 2, the product to be recycled was modularised
 by the grouping genetic algorithms. At Stage 3, the disassembly cost
 and recycle profit of the modules were evaluated. At Stage 4, an
 interference matrix was used to specify the disassembly sequential
 order of product modules and parts. Finally, the stapler was used
 as an example to illustrate the proposed assessment methodology.

 The purpose of this paper essentially aims at establishing a complexity
 index for practitioners to decide what type of algorithm employed,

 threshold of the proposed complexity judgment is hinged on the square
 of preceding constraints and the quantity of nodes in the event.
 As the complexity increases the frequency of feasible solutions found
 did not exactly come up by traditional GAs. According to the proposed
 index assembly sequence problems are asserted more constraints comparatively

 hands are required? How many degrees of freedom? What parts should

 answer such questions automatically, important theoretical issues
 in geometric reasoning must be addressed. This paper investigates
 the planning of assembly algorithms specifying (dis) assembly operations
 on the components of a product and the ordering of these operations.
 It also presents measures to evaluate the complexity of these algorithms
 and techniques to estimate the inherent complexity of a product.
 The central concept underlying these planning and complexity evaluation
 techniques is that of a "non-directional blocking graph", a qualitative
 representation of the internal structure of an assembly product.
 This representation describes the combinatorial set of parts interactions
 in polynomial space. It is obtained by identifying physical criticalities
 where geometric interferences among parts change. It is generated
 from an input geometric description of the product. The main application
 considered in the paper is the creation of smart environments to
 help designers create products that are easier to manufacture and
 service. Other possible applications include planning for rapid prototyping
 and autonomous robots. Â© 1994.},

 for mechanical assemblies},

  volume = {35},
  pages = {37-56},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {This paper presents an approach to find feasible and practical plans
 for mechanical assemblies based on a connector-based structure (CBS)
 hierarchy. The basic idea of the approach is to construct plans for
 an assembly (i.e. the root node of the CBS hierarchy) by systematically
 merging plans for primitive structures in the CBS hierarchy, while
 the plans for primitive structures are built using one of three methods:
 by reusing the existing plans, by retrieving the stored plans, and
 by geometric reasoning. The input to the approach consists of the
 assembly solid model, the connector-based relational model (CBRM)
 graph, the spatial constraint graphs, and the selected base part
 for the assembly, all of which are assumed to be generated previously
 in an interactive and/or automated way. Then, a CBS hierarchy for
 the assembly is automatically derived from the input CBRM by firstly
 establishing its functional model, which is constructed from the
 CBRM by decomposing the assembly or resulted part sets with respect
 to their connectors. Based on the CBS hierarchy, a set of assembly
 precedence diagrams representing good plans for the assembly are
 generated by merging plans for primitive structures systematically
 in a bottom-up manner. It can be proved that the proposed approach
 is both correct and complete. To verify the validness and efficiency
 of the approach, a variety of assemblies including some complicated
 products from industry are tested in the experimental CBHAP planner.

abstract ={We propose a representation and a planning algorithm able to deal with problems integrating task planning as well as motion and manipulation planning knowledge involving several robots and objects. Robot plans often include actions where the robot has to place itself in some position in order to perform some other action or to ?modify? the configuration of its environment by displacing objects. Our approach aims at establishing a bridge between task planning and manipulation planning that allows a rigorous treatment of geometric preconditions and effects of robot actions in realistic environments. We show how links can be established between a symbolic description and its geometric counterpart and how they can be used in an integrated planning process that is able to deal with intricate symbolic and geometric constraints. Finally, we describe the main features of an implemented planner and discuss several examples of its use.

abstract ={We propose a constraint-based approach to address a class of problems encountered in combined task and motion planning (CTAMP), which we call kinematically constrained problems. CTAMP is a hybrid planning process in which task planning and geometric reasoning are interleaved. During this process, symbolic action sequences generated by a task planner are geometrically evaluated. This geometric evaluation is a search problem per se, which we refer to as geometric backtrack search. In kinematically constrained problems, a significant computational effort is spent on geometric backtrack search, which impairs search at the task level. At the basis of our approach to address this problem, is the introduction of an intermediate layer between task planning and geometric reasoning. A set of constraints is automatically generated from the symbolic action sequences to evaluate, and combined with a set of constraints derived from the kinematic model of the robot. The resulting constrai
nt network is then used to prune the search space during geometric backtrack search. We present experimental evidence that our approach significantly reduces the complexity of geometric backtrack search on various types of problem.},

  ABSTRACT =      {NASA missions require solving a wide variety of planning and scheduling problems with temporal constraints; simple resources such as robotic arms, communications antennae and cameras; complex replenishable resources such as memory, power and fuel; and complex constraints on geometry, heat and lighting angles. Planners and schedulers that solve these problems are used in ground tools as well as onboard systems. The diversity of planning problems and applications of planners and schedulers precludes a one-size fits all solution. However, many of the underlying technologies are common across planning domains and applications. We describe CAPR, a formalism for planning that is general enough to cover a wide variety of planning and scheduling domains of interest to NASA. We then describe EUROPA(sub 2), a software framework implementing CAPR. EUROPA(sub 2) provides efficient, customizable Plan Database Services that enable the integration of CAPR into a wide variety of applications. We describe the design of EUROPA(sub 2) from the perspective of both modeling, customization and application integration to different classes of NASA missions.},
