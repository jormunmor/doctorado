abstract={From exploring planets to cleaning homes, the reach and versatility of robotics is vast. The integration of actuation, sensing and control makes robotics systems powerful, but complicates their simulation. This paper introduces a versatile, scalable, yet powerful general-purpose robot simulation framework called V-REP. The paper discusses the utility of a portable and flexible simulation framework that allows for direct incorporation of various control techniques. This renders simulations and simulation models more accessible to a general-public, by reducing the simulation model deployment complexity. It also increases productivity by offering built-in and ready-to-use functionalities, as well as a multitude of programming approaches. This allows for a multitude of applications including rapid algorithm development, system verification, rapid prototyping, and deployment for cases such as safety/remote monitoring, training and education, hardware control, and factory automation simulation.},

abstract ={We propose a representation and a planning algorithm able to deal with problems integrating task planning as well as motion and manipulation planning knowledge involving several robots and objects. Robot plans often include actions where the robot has to place itself in some position in order to perform some other action or to ?modify? the configuration of its environment by displacing objects. Our approach aims at establishing a bridge between task planning and manipulation planning that allows a rigorous treatment of geometric preconditions and effects of robot actions in realistic environments. We show how links can be established between a symbolic description and its geometric counterpart and how they can be used in an integrated planning process that is able to deal with intricate symbolic and geometric constraints. Finally, we describe the main features of an implemented planner and discuss several examples of its use.

abstract ={We propose a constraint-based approach to address a class of problems encountered in combined task and motion planning (CTAMP), which we call kinematically constrained problems. CTAMP is a hybrid planning process in which task planning and geometric reasoning are interleaved. During this process, symbolic action sequences generated by a task planner are geometrically evaluated. This geometric evaluation is a search problem per se, which we refer to as geometric backtrack search. In kinematically constrained problems, a significant computational effort is spent on geometric backtrack search, which impairs search at the task level. At the basis of our approach to address this problem, is the introduction of an intermediate layer between task planning and geometric reasoning. A set of constraints is automatically generated from the symbolic action sequences to evaluate, and combined with a set of constraints derived from the kinematic model of the robot. The resulting constrai
nt network is then used to prune the search space during geometric backtrack search. We present experimental evidence that our approach significantly reduces the complexity of geometric backtrack search on various types of problem.},

  ABSTRACT =      {NASA missions require solving a wide variety of planning and scheduling problems with temporal constraints; simple resources such as robotic arms, communications antennae and cameras; complex replenishable resources such as memory, power and fuel; and complex constraints on geometry, heat and lighting angles. Planners and schedulers that solve these problems are used in ground tools as well as onboard systems. The diversity of planning problems and applications of planners and schedulers precludes a one-size fits all solution. However, many of the underlying technologies are common across planning domains and applications. We describe CAPR, a formalism for planning that is general enough to cover a wide variety of planning and scheduling domains of interest to NASA. We then describe EUROPA(sub 2), a software framework implementing CAPR. EUROPA(sub 2) provides efficient, customizable Plan Database Services that enable the integration of CAPR into a wide variety of applications. We describe the design of EUROPA(sub 2) from the perspective of both modeling, customization and application integration to different classes of NASA missions.},
