Write over the assignment_problem_part.txt the assignment of the problem. Later, concat the content of
the text files in the order:

first_problem_part.txt + assembly_planner_part.txt + assignment_problem_part.txt + second_problem_part.txt

and rename it as a file called 'problem' (without the .txt extension).
